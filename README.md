The porject consists of *Agents* getting boxes in a storage zone (brown) and bringing them in another place (green). There is just a wall between zones opened by 2 small corridors.

*Agents* just know his location and the locations of the 2 zones. They cannot "talk" to each other, they can just "see" surroundings to 3 tiles far and meorize it.

Engine, UI and Agents can be launched on differents computers while they comunicate via XML-RPC.

The team working in the project is composed of the following students :
- @VincentCarassus
- @Floki
- @loclamor
- @xvarlez

At the end of the project (at the time of project report) there is still some bugs. They can be found in issues, listed in [the issue number 15](https://github.com/loclamor/fenwicklife/issues/15)

Thank you for your interest in the project.
